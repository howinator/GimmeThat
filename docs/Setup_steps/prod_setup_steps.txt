1) Set environment variables for secret key in virtualenv
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9554087/setting-an-environment-variable-in-virtualenv
    Need to set SECRET_KEY, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE (pg. 44 of Two Scoops)

1) Set up user/group/directory according to this guide (http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2013/06/09/django-nginx-gunicorn-virtualenv-supervisor/)
    Directory: /var/www/gimmeth.at

2) Put the virtualenv inside ~/Envs where ~ is the project directory (home directory of the project user) [~=/var/www/gimmeth.at]
If you use virtualenvwrapper, you have to use virtualenvwrapper in the gunciron script (I don't know why)
    This also means you have to source virtualenvwrapper (usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper)

3) Follow the rest of the steps in that blog post (saved in Documents)a

4) For the environment variables, you'll do two things: 
    i) make a script called secrets.sh which will contain "export SECRET_KEY='xyz' export DB_PASSWORD='xyz' etc"
        Notice the single quotes!
    ii) Also set the environment variables in $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate then unset them in predeactivate
        Three environment vairbales are SECRET_KEY, DB_PASSWORD, DB_USER, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, RECPATCHA_PRIVATE_KEY, RECPATCHA_PUBLIC_KEY
        Honestly I'm not sure if supervisor is pulling the envirionment variables from secrets.sh or the virtualenv. This should be tested

5) Create symlink from supervisord.conf file to /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf. Basically, I'm version controlling supervisor conf script so I need to symlink it into /etc/

6) Create symlink for ngnix (ln -s /var/www/gimmeth.at/bin/gimmethat-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/gimmethat-nginx.conf)
    Create symlink from sites-available to sites-enabled



Note: I made a copy of the nginx config file in /etc/nginx
