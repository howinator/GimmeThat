1) Set up user/group/directory according to this guide (http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2013/06/09/django-nginx-gunicorn-virtualenv-supervisor/)
    Directory: /var/www/gimmeth.at

2) Put the virtualenv inside ~/Envs where ~ is the project directory (home directory of the project user) [~=/var/www/gimmeth.at]
If you use virtualenvwrapper, you have to use virtualenvwrapper in the gunciron script (I don't know why)
    This also means you have to source virtualenvwrapper (usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper)

3) Follow the rest of the steps in that blog post (saved in Documents)a

4) For the environment variables, you'll do two things: 
    i) make a script called secrets.sh which will contain "export SECRET_KEY='xyz' export DB_PASSWORD='xyz' etc"
        Notice the single quotes!
        Three environment vairbales are SECRET_KEY, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_USEr
    ii) source the secrets.sh in your gunicorn script



Note: I made a copy of the nginx config file in /etc/nginx
